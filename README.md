# OutFlick Scraper

This is a package that fetches product data from websites like Uniqlo and Zara and formats
them into a data model that can easily be added to a SQL database.

This package also features a CLI tool to easily manage raw JSON data and parses in a SQLite file to manage parsing 
for versioning and committing to a remote database.
