# OutFlick Scraper

This is a work in progress package to fetch product data from websites like Uniqlo and Zara and format 
them into an object that can easily be added to a SQL database.

This package will also feature a CLI tool to easily manage raw JSON data and parses in a SQLite file to manage parsing 
for versioning and committing to a remote database.

## Disclaimer

I have not added code for the parsers yet but in advance I am not responsible for what anyone does with it. 
This package is for educational/demonstrative purposes only.
